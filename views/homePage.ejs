            <p>the experience of building a site with a group was an amazing experience I hadn't done before.
            I learnd a lot about my conduct in a group and alone.
            we all worked as a team and I had a lot of fun.
            in addition I worked alone on my part and I enjoyed the development of my thinking and learn in a different special way.</p>
